# Chef Infra Policy

Policy in chef maps, operational requirements, process, workflow, settings, and objects stored in the chef server.

Aspects of Chef Policy include:

* Role - which will define patterns and processes that persist for a certain job function
* Environment - which will define differences along a chef workflow
* Cookbooks (and their versions) - #TODO
* Run-list
* Data Bags - Think secrets; this is where global variables of sensitive information is stored and is loaded by a cookbook
* Policy Files - an optional way to specify policy, will be utilized by the chef infra client during a run.

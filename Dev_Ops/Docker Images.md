# Docker Images

Images are the container version of VMs templates. They are like a blueprint that tells the docker engine how to build the container.
In the same way that a virtual machine template is essentially a stopped virtual machine an image is essentially a container that has been stopped.
Like VM templates an image is a construct for build time.

## The Basic Docker Container

At the most basic level a docker image will define what shell and the OS's file system that its children containers will use
__Note: Its easy to think of image being to container what class is to object__

On top of these basics the developers of the applications that will run on the container can add the application code and all of the dependencies required to make it.

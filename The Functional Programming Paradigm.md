# The Functional Programming Paradigm

To work within the functional paradigm and solve problems you must manage data so that the functions can occur in any order and at any time (opening up for parallel execution etc)

Which means:

* No mutable variables that maintain any sort of state
* And functions must not change the state of any variable that is not directly declared within itself

The two things above take the code a long way not towards not causing bugs and other reliability issues

## Declarations vs. Procedures

See [Declarations & Procedures](Declarations%20vs.%20Procedures.md & Procedures.md>)

## Immutable data
See [Immutable Data](<./Immutable Data.md>)

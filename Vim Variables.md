# Vim Variables and Let



# Let Capabilities

Let is more capable than set in the sense that it can access:

* Regex
* Variables
* Registers
* Functions
* Math
* String Manipulations

#TODO sort out all the links to these when I get the time because I can't be bothered now... 

Though this changes depending on your version of the editor

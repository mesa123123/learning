# Vimscript Echo and Echom

## Echo
Echo works similarly to its shell counterpart it simply echos the command to the output box at the bottom of the screen
This command is useful for printing out the values of various variables for the current vim session

## Echom and Persistent Echoing
This is different to its echo counterpart as it adds the output to the messages dialog, think of echom as a persistent message

## The Message Dialog

To bring this up run the `:messages` command
Also see [Vimscript Messages](<./vimscript message.md> "Vimscript Messages")

_ NOTES _
* _ echo and echom also work in .vimrc files _

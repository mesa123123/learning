#### Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCWaFLy3VUo

Web Components are a function of the web that arise from a set of web platform APIs that can create custom encapsulated html tags for web apps.

Unlike Vue Components or React Components they do not require 3rd party libraries or a package manager (though they can be integrated with all of these).

There are 3 main web standards that allow for this functionality on the web

* [Custom Elements](./Custom HTML Elements.md)
* [Shadow DOM](./HTML Shadow DOM.md)
* [HTML Templates](./HTML Templates.md)

In order to use web components to their full extent you will need to know all three

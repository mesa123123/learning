# Vim Mappings

In short, mappings is the word for vims Keyboard Shortcuts.

## Mappings > Keyboard Shortcuts

Mappings however, are superior to keyboard shortcuts as you aren't just giving defined keyboard function to a set of pressed keys...

Its better to think of mappings as a kind of macro instruction, i.e. you define the set of instructions that are going to be carried out when the key is pressed

# MermaidJS
Is a diagramming as code system that works on top of npm and renders in the browser

It runs using text based tools thus making it more platform agnostic than visio or libre draw alternatives.

## Supported Diagrams

* Flowchart
* Pie Chart
* Sequence
* Gantt
* Class
* Git Graph [beta]
* Entity Relationship Diagram [beta]
* User Journey Diagram

## Installing

You can install mermaidJS with yarn/npm or through a CDN
Also I've made a extension so this will work with vim :D

# Airflow Principles

The development of airflow project is created under the following principles:

* Dynamic
* Extensible
* Elegant
* Scalable

## Dynamic

Airflow pipelines are configuration as code (Python), allowing for dynamic pipeline generation. This allows for writing code that instantiates pipelines dynamically.

## Extensible

Easily define your own operators, executors and extend the library so that it fits the level of abstraction that suits your environment.

## Elegant

Airflow pipelines are lean and explicit. Parametrizing your scripts is built into the core of Airflow.

## Scalable

Airflow has a modular architecture and uses a message queue to orchestrate an arbitrary number of workers
